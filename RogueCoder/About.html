    <p>
        This game was created for the 7 day rouguelike comp in 2013.

        I have used the roguebase framework I built for my entries in this years (2013) 1GAM (onegameamonth.com) comp. A lot of the ideas for this game emerged from my
        first attempt at a 7DRL last year (CyberPrisonEscape). That was a failure but taught me a lot about 7DRL's. Feel free to leave a comment <a href="Contactme.html"> Contact me </a>
